### **Approach**  
This project focuses on building a scalable and robust pipeline for **financial data extraction**, **key metric retrieval**, and **summary generation**, while incorporating evaluation mechanisms for assessing performance. The process involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**  
   - Input data, such as financial statements in PDF or JSON format, is pre-processed into structured representations.  
   - A **vector store** is created using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI embeddings) to break the data into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval.  

2. **Retriever-Based Context Augmentation**  
   - A **retriever mechanism** is employed to fetch the most relevant chunks of text from the vector store for downstream tasks.  
   - This ensures the solution can handle large or lengthy financial statements by focusing only on meaningful sections.

3. **Key Metric Extraction**  
   - A language model is prompted to extract financial metrics (e.g., revenue, net income) as a dictionary of numeric values.  
   - Missing values are assigned `null`, ensuring clean and structured outputs.

4. **Summary Generation**  
   - The retrieved chunks and extracted metrics are combined to generate a concise narrative summary of financial health.  
   - The language model produces outputs in JSON format, with clear separation of the summary text and key metrics.

5. **Evaluation Framework**  
   - The pipeline incorporates robust evaluation methods:  
     - **Data Extraction**: Partial precision, recall, and an overall extraction score to measure how well the extracted data matches the ground truth.  
     - **Key Metric Accuracy**: MAE, RMSE, and exact-match precision, recall, and F1 to assess numerical correctness.  
     - **Summary Quality**: Evaluated using keyword coverage, length checks, and optional advanced scoring (e.g., LLM-based evaluation).  

6. **Modular Design**  
   - Each step in the pipeline (data ingestion, vector store creation, metric extraction, summary generation, and evaluation) is implemented as a reusable module, ensuring scalability, reusability, and ease of integration.

## **Challenges**

1. **Accurately Extracting Data from PDFs**  
   - Financial data in PDFs is often presented in complex layouts with tables, headers, footers, and varying formats, making it difficult to extract structured information consistently.

2. **Structuring Extracted Data for Financial Purposes**  
   - The extracted data needed to be tailored specifically to financial use cases, requiring careful handling to ensure core metrics (e.g., revenue, operating expenses) were identified and structured appropriately.

3. **Handling Large or Lengthy Financial Statements**  
   - Large financial documents introduced challenges in processing latency and accuracy, requiring a scalable approach to retrieve only the most relevant sections.

4. **Evaluating Extracted Data Accuracy**  
   - With ground truth data often partial or incomplete, evaluating extraction performance demanded customized metrics like partial precision and recall to fairly assess results.

5. **Financial Report/Summary Evaluation**  
   - Evaluating narrative summaries posed challenges in defining objective metrics, such as coverage of relevant information and adherence to user-specific requests.

6. **Ensuring Modular and Reusable Code**  
   - The system needed a modular structure to allow independent use of components (e.g., ingestion, retrieval, or evaluation) and ensure scalability for future financial data projects.

## **Solutions Implemented**

1. **PDF Data Extraction with Preprocessing**  
   - Leveraged libraries like PyPDF2 or PDFPlumber to extract raw text while handling headers, footers, and table structures. Post-extraction cleaning segmented meaningful sections and prepared them for further processing.

2. **Retriever-Based Context Augmentation**  
   - A vector store was built using embeddings to chunk large financial documents. A retriever mechanism identified the most relevant sections for downstream tasks, ensuring scalability and relevance even for lengthy inputs.

3. **Structured Outputs for Financial Use Cases**  
   - A language model was instructed to return financial data in structured JSON format, including key metrics (e.g., revenue, net income) as numeric values or `null`. This ensured the extracted data was tailored to financial applications.

4. **Evaluation Metrics for Extraction & Summaries**  
   - Introduced partial precision/recall metrics for data extraction, which focused only on known ground truth values.  
   - Key metric accuracy was evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and exact-match precision, recall, and F1.  
   - Summary quality was assessed using keyword coverage, length checks, and optional LLM-based scoring.

5. **Scalable & Modular Design**  
   - The pipeline was implemented as modular components:  
     - **Data ingestion**: Flexible to handle folders, JSON files, or plain text.  
     - **Retriever and vector store**: Scalable for large documents, with efficient chunking and retrieval.  
     - **Metric extraction and summaries**: Independent modules that integrate seamlessly with retrieval.  
     - **Evaluation framework**: Modular metrics to assess extraction, numeric accuracy, and summary quality.

## **Conclusion**

This project integrates a modular and scalable pipeline for extracting financial data, retrieving relevant information, and generating summaries with high accuracy and reliability. By employing a **retriever mechanism**, it handles large or lengthy financial documents efficiently, focusing on the most relevant sections to optimize processing and accuracy. The structured outputs and evaluation framework ensure the solution meets financial domain-specific requirements, with clear metrics for assessing performance at each stage. The modular design facilitates reusability and scalability, making it adaptable for future financial data processing tasks.
