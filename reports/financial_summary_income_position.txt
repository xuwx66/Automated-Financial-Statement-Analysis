#### Narrative Summary:
The company demonstrated a stable financial performance with a slight increase in total revenue, primarily from membership subscriptions and interest income. However, the rise in expenses, particularly legal and administration costs, led to a reduced surplus compared to the previous year. The strategic acquisition of land and buildings significantly boosted non-current assets, although it also increased liabilities due to new borrowings. Overall, the company maintains a healthy net asset position, reflecting a solid equity base despite the challenges in managing increased expenses.
